    "# SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely deployed SQL database engine in the world. The source code for SQLite is in the public domain.\n",
    "SQLite is not directly comparable to client/server SQL database engines such as MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server since SQLite is trying to solve a different problem. \n",
    "Client/server SQL database engines strive to implement a shared repository of enterprise data. They emphasize scalability, concurrency, centralization, and control. SQLite strives to provide local data storage for individual applications and devices. SQLite emphasizes economy, efficiency, reliability, independence, and simplicity. \n",
    "When not to Use SQLITE ?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Client/Server Applications\n",
    "If there are many client programs sending SQL to the same database over a network, then use a client/server database engine instead of SQLite.\n",
    "High-volume Websites\n",
    "SQLite will normally work fine as the database backend to a website. But if the website is write-intensive or is so busy that it requires multiple servers, then consider using an enterprise-class client/server database engine instead of SQLite.\n",
    "Very large datasets\n",
    "An SQLite database is limited in size to 140 terabytes (247 bytes, 128 tibibytes).\n",
    "High Concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite supports an unlimited number of simultaneous readers, but it will only allow one writer at any instant in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection objects\n",
    "Connection objects create a connection with the database and these are further used for different transactions. These connection objects are also used as representatives of the database session.\n",
    "You can use a connection object for calling methods like commit(), rollback() and close()\n",
    "Cursor objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Cursor is one of the powerful features of SQL. These are objects that are responsible for submitting various SQL statements to a database server. \n",
    " \n",
    "```python \n",
    "sqlite3.connect(database [,timeout ,other optional arguments])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This API opens a connection to the SQLite database file. You can use \":memory:\" to open a database connection to a database that resides in RAM instead of on disk. If database is opened successfully, it returns a connection object.\n",
    "When a database is accessed by multiple connections, and one of the processes modifies the database, the SQLite database is locked until that transaction is committed. The timeout parameter specifies how long the connection should wait for the lock to go away until raising an exception. The default for the timeout parameter is 5.0 (five seconds).\n",
    "If the given database name does not exist then this call will create the database. You can specify filename with the required path as well if you want to create a database anywhere else except in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "connection.cursor([cursorClass])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This routine creates a cursor which will be used throughout of your database programming with Python. This method accepts a single optional parameter cursorClass. If supplied, this must be a custom cursor class that extends sqlite3.Cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "cursor.execute(sql [, optional parameters])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This routine executes an SQL statement. The SQL statement may be parameterized (i. e. placeholders instead of SQL literals). The sqlite3 module supports two kinds of placeholders: question marks and named placeholders (named style).\n",
    "For example âˆ’ cursor.execute(\"insert into people values (?, ?)\", (who, age))\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "connection.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This method commits the current transaction. If you don't call this method, anything you did since the last call to commit() is not visible from other database connections.\n",
    "```python \n",
    "connection.rollback()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This method rolls back any changes to the database since the last call to commit\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "connection.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method closes the database connection. Note that this does not automatically call commit(). If you just close your database connection without calling commit() first, your changes will be lost!\n"
