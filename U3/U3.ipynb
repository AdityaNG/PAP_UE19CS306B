    "1. The Consumer checks if the buffer is empty before consuming.\n",
    "2. If the buffer is empty, it calls **wait()** on the condition instance.\n",
    "3. **wait()** blocks the consumer and also releases the lock associated with the condition, i.e it loses hold of the lock.\n",
    "4. Now unless consumer is notified, it will not run.\n",
    "5. Now, the Producer can acquire the lock as it was released by the Consumer.\n",
    "6. Producer puts data into the buffer and calls **notify()** on the condition instance.\n",
    "7. Once **notify()** call is made on condition, Consumer wakes up. But waking up doesn’t mean it starts executing.\n",
    "8. **notify()** does not release the lock. Even after **notify()**, lock is still held by the Producer.\n",
    "9. Producer explicitly releases the lock by using **condition.release()**.\n",
    "10. Consumer starts running again and it'll consume the data in the buffer.\n",
    "11. No IndexError will be raised."
