    "## Process\n",
    "A process is an active program i.e. a program that is under execution. It is more than the program code as it includes the program counter, process stack, registers, program code etc. Compared to this, the program code is only the text section.\n",

    "## Thread\n",
    "A thread is a lightweight process that can be managed independently by a scheduler. It improves the application performance using parallelism. A thread shares information like data segment, code segment, files etc. with its peer threads while it contains its own registers, stack, counter etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, you can assume that a thread is simply a subset of a process!"
