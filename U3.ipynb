    "## Process\n",
    "A process is an active program i.e. a program that is under execution. It is more than the program code as it includes the program counter, process stack, registers, program code etc. Compared to this, the program code is only the text section.\n",

    "## Thread\n",
    "A thread is a lightweight process that can be managed independently by a scheduler. It improves the application performance using parallelism. A thread shares information like data segment, code segment, files etc. with its peer threads while it contains its own registers, stack, counter etc.\n",

    "3. Since buffer is a shared variable, we keep it inside lock to avoid race condition.\n",
    "4. At some point, consumer has consumed everything and producer is still sleeping. Consumer tries to consume more but since buffer is empty, an IndexError is raised.\n",
